            <p>Enjoy Filming Club is a student run organization based in Boston 
            University. Our vision is to create an oasis for passionate movie 
            creators and movie lovers. One of the biggest challenge of making 
            films is lack of resources. Talents, equipments, settings, etc, 
            are essential for producing good films, but they are difficult to 
            obtain, especially for students. EFC recognizes student filmmakersâ€™ 
            needs and provides resources for its members to help them to land their 
            projects on the big screen. For now, EFC has helped to produced more 
            than 20 highly acclaimed films, recognized by the community and the 
            professionals. We also host weekly screening activities, which is a 
            more . EFC is a big family and new members are always welcomed. For 
            more information, please contact us.
