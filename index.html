                    <p class="content">Enjoy Filming Club is a student run organization based 
                        in Boston University. It is composed of a group of 
                        diverse, passionate, highly collaborative creatives. 
                        Our vision is to create an oasis for passionate movie 
                        creators and movie lovers. One of the biggest challenge 
                        of making films is lack of resources. Talents, equipments,
                        settings, etc, are essential for producing good films, 
                        but they are difficult to obtain, especially for students.
                        EFC recognizes student filmmakersâ€™ needs and provides resources 
                        for its members to help them to land their projects on the big 
                        screen. </p>
                        
                    <p class="content">For now, EFC has produced over 20 films, and its efforts is 
                        recognized by the community and the professionals. Beyond that, 
                        We also host weekly screening, which is a great chance for members 
                        to meetup and have fun, or for prospective members to take glimpse of our 
                        club. EFC is a big family and new members are always welcomed.
