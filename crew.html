                EFCâ€™s most valuable assets are its members and the bonds
                 established between them after they work on one after  
                 another projects. Our members came from all kinds of 
                 backgrounds, but we share a common passion for movies 
                 and we work toward a common goal: making films that we 
                 are proud of.  At this page , we try to honor as much 
                 club members as we could, as a reminder of the great 
                 works they have done and the beautiful memories they 
                 have in EFC.
